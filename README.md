# Dawson Hackathon 
Resources for Arduino Navigation Challenge.

The Arduino navigation challenge will involve the construction of a micro-robot designed to navigate a set of paths using two different sensors: by line following using colour sensors and through a maze by remote control. Student teams (minimum 2, maximum 4) will be provided with a kit of components and precise instructions for scoring. 

What is Arduino?

Arduino is an open-source hardware and software electronics platform. Arduino boards are able to read inputs - light on a sensor, a finger on a button, or a Twitter message - and turn it into an output - activating a motor, turning on an LED, publishing something online. You can tell your board what to do by sending instructions to the microcontroller on the board. This is done with the Arduino programming language (basically C++ with specific libraries), and the Arduino IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
